# Increasing Maritime Domain Awareness using spatio-temporal sequential data
Ships continuously transmit Automatic Identification System (AIS) messages containing their identity, position, speed, course and time of transmission, thus forming spatio-temporal trajectories. AIS is widely used for traffic monitoring, logistics, and safety applications.

During this project, the participants will handle irregularly sampled, noisy and error-prone time series data (AIS is real data, not a toy dataset) and implement a model for sequential data (e.g., RNN, transformer) to solve one of the following challenges:
- Trajectory prediction: Forecasting the future path of a vessel based on its historical movements by estimating the next point in a sequence.
- Anomaly detection: Identifying unusual vessel behavior, such as deviations from typical movement patterns, with self-supervised learning.
- Port call prediction: Classify the next port of arrival and estimate the time of arrival.
